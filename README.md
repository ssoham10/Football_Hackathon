# Football_Hackathon
A project on Data Driven Player Performance Assessment.
This was my first AI Hackathon organized by Analytics Vidhya. It was in collaboration with Sevilla FC (Spain) and FC Bengaluru United (India).
In this Hackathon, participants were given access to datasets with various physical, contextual, kinematical, technical, and tactical oriented data related to the players, the team as a whole, and their opponents. 
The participants were expected to create an AI application which could help in predicting the rating of the players (usually rated by scouts) with the help of the data, thus advancing and automating the process of scouting of players.
